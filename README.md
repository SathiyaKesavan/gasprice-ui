This projects demonstrates use of kafka message streams and data persistence using noSQL database.
1. A producer produces a new message everyday by calling an endpoint which returns gas prices US. This message is dropped on to kafka.
2. A consumer service, reads these messages and persists them into MongoDB documents.
3. A microservice queries the mongoDB and fetches data for clients to consume.
4. Frontend invokes the microservice to paint the UX page with gas price data and trend.
